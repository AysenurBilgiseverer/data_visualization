The Effects of COVID-19 on Students

COVID-19 has changed the way we live, our daily life and our habits. We have been trying to adapt to our new lifestyle for about 14-15 months. I think that the group that felt and experienced this change the most was the students and the educators. My goal is to visualize data such as how much time they spend in online education, which tool they attend online classes, how many hours they sleep, and in this way present their situation clearly.

Dataset: The dataset named "COVID-19 and its Impact on Students" taken from Kaggle and shared by Kunal chaturvedi will be used. This datasette includes data from a survey conducted with 1182 individuals of different ages and studying at different educational institutions in Delhi. Dataset contains answers to 18 questions asked students. You can access the dataset from the link below. https://www.kaggle.com/kunal28chaturvedi/covid19-and-its-impact-on-students
