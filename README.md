## Effects of COVID-19 on Students

COVID-19 has changed the way we live, our daily life and our habits. We have been trying to adapt to our new lifestyle for about 14-15 months. I think that the group that felt and experienced this change the most was the students and the educators. My goal is to visualize data such as how much time they spend in online education, which tool they attend online classes, how many hours they sleep, and in this way present their situation clearly.

### Dataset
The dataset named "COVID-19 and its Impact on Students" taken from Kaggle and shared by Kunal chaturvedi will be used. This datasette includes data from a survey conducted with 1182 individuals of different ages and studying at different educational institutions in Delhi. Dataset contains answers to 18 questions asked students. You can access the dataset from the link below.

In this project, it is planned to visualize 6 selected question answers of 1195 students. There are nearly 7200 data.
### Graphs Creation
Charts were created with Excel and DataWrapper. Pviot table was used in Excel and then Pviot Charts were created.

### Article Review
Many studies have been carried out to investigate the psychological effects of epidemic diseases on people. It has been observed that the stress experienced by people in this period causes immediate problems such as anxiety and depression, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder and vicarious traumatization, which have long-term effects. (Oniema et al., 2020 as cited in van et al., 2016). In order to get rid of stress and get rid of these bad effects, individuals turn to different activities and these are stress-relieving activities for stress relief and relaxation. Examples of these activities are listening to music, playing online games, reading books.
According to the statements of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), closures have been implemented in more than 100 countries, in which more than half of the student population is. In addition, school closures cause social, educational, economic costs and disruptions to human interactions in communities, and its effects are felt most by disadvantaged individuals and their families. (UNESCO, 2020).
In the news quoted by VOA News (2020), UNESCO Director-General Andrey Azoulayals said that unplanned school closures will cause problems for students, families, educators and society. In addition, it was stated that the academic interests and performances of the students would be affected. He stated that if students are not engaged effectively, it will cause laziness to be associated with young people committing crimes, loss of interest in learning, and poor academic performance. It disorganizes life away from school and leads people to live unplanned, and as a result, it causes concentration problems and a decrease in interest in learning and working.
